In a new study of languages spoken in 43 different populations worldwide, Yale School of Medicine researchers and their colleagues identified variants of a dyslexia gene that correlate with consonant use, establishing a role for genetics in language differences between populations.

The brain uses distinct strategies to process and encode vowels and consonants, which are modified by at least one dyslexia gene, according to the study, which was published in the April issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study also showed that genetic variations, along with other cultural and linguistic processes, may account for differences in consonant use between populations.

There are more than 7,000 languages spoken globally, which are thought to have been shaped by migration, conquests, and geographic isolation of populations. However, this new study suggests that genetic factors also play a role in changes in language, said the researchers.

Led by senior author Jeffrey Gruen, M.D., professor of pediatrics and of genetics at Yale School of Medicine, the research team traced READ1 sequences — a gene regulator associated with dyslexia — in nonhuman primates, Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans. They found that the regulatory sequence changed between 550,000 and 4 million years ago.  They compared READ1 variants among 43 populations from five continents with the numbers of consonants and of vowels present in the languages spoken by those populations. The number of consonants — but not of vowels — correlated with the frequency of RU1-1, a READ1 variant in the language’s population.

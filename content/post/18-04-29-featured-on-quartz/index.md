Languages are dynamic. After just a few hundred years, the English of Chaucer looks bizarre to today’s readers.

The factors that drive language changes are familiar. Interaction with other languages: Roman conquest spread the influence of Latin across Europe. Metaphor: The description of a circle as “round” came to refer to a “well-rounded” individual. New needs: Technological change requires the formation of words like “internet.”

A new study proposes another, surprising mechanism behind language change: genes. A group led by researchers at Yale University wondered whether the presence of a gene called DCDC2, which has previously been shown to influence how sounds are processed by the brain, might have played a role in linguistic change over the millennia.

“Traditionally language change is not often attributed to genetics, full stop,” says Kevin Tang, a linguist who worked on the research.

The researchers aimed to do just that, by synthesizing a few working theories about the gene in question.
